# Twitch Chat Overlay

- NextJS
- ShadCN

This is just a work in progress fun side project I'm working on. Open to contributions!

## The Objective
As this will be entirely client side ran, I'm hoping to build a super easy way for you to download this (likely Electron or Tauri) and then simply input your Twitch username and add the overlay to your OBS.

## Todo List
- [ ] Basic styling
- [ ] Styling options
- [ ] Build for local (easy as possible for the end user)
- [ ] Ready for use
